# HTML exercise 09: Choosing the correct field

There are many ways to represent the data the server needs in an HTML `<form>`. Some fields are simple text fields. Others expect an array of values for each name.

In this exercise, we'll build the form fields based on what the server expects for each field type.

Have a look at the `09-correct-fields.html` file. It contains comments about what the server expects. Think about all the possible ways of achieving these outcomes.

Save, `add`, and then `commit` your changes in your forked repo. Make sure to `push`!
